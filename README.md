## Usage

### ACDC Data Preparation
1. Register and download ACDC-2017 dataset from https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/Challenge/acdc/index.html
2. Create a folder outside the project with name **ACDC_DataSet** and copy the dataset.
3. From the project folder open file data_preprocess/acdc_data_preparation.py.
4. In the file, set the path to ACDC training dataset is pointed as: ```complete_data_path = '../../ACDC_DataSet/training' ```.
5. Run the script acdc_data_preparation.py.
6. The processed data for training is generated outside the project folder named *processed_acdc_dataset*.
7. Run the ./libs/datastes/gen_acdcjson.py to generate the data list for ACDC training and validation.

### Training
```
cd ./tools
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node 4 --master_port $RANDOM train.py --batch_size 32 --mgpus 0,1,2,3 --output_dir logs/... --train_with_eval
```
